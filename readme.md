## Introduction

My application, called "Epicreate," is designed to allow users to create, delete, and view RPG characters. It's a text-based interface where users can interact by selecting options from a menu.

1. Main Menu:

When you start the application, you are greeted with a main menu. Here are the options:

 - Create a character (Option 1): Allows you to create a new RPG character. You'll be prompted to enter the character's name, race (Human, Elf, or Dwarf), and class (Warrior, Mage, or Rogue).
 - Delete created character (Option 2): Lets you remove a character that you previously created. You'll see a list of your characters and can choose which one to delete.
 - View created characters (Option 3): Displays a list of all characters you've created along with their details, such as name, race, class, attributes, and abilities.
 - Exit the application (Option 4): Allows you to exit the application.

2. Creating a Character:

 To create a character:

 - Choose option 1 from the main menu.
 - Enter the character's name, race, and class.
 - The application will then display the details of the created character, including their attributes and abilities.
 - The character is automatically saved to a CSV file for future reference.

3. Deleting a Character:

 To delete a character:

 - Choose option 2 from the main menu.
 - You'll see a list of your characters with corresponding numbers.
 - Enter the number of the character you want to delete.
 - The selected character will be removed from the list, and the updated list will be displayed.
 - The removed character is deleted from the CSV file.

4. Viewing Characters:

 To view all created characters:

 - Choose option 3 from the main menu.
 - The application will display a table with details of each character, including name, race, class, attributes, and abilities.
 - You can review the information for all characters you've created.

5. Exiting the Application:

 To exit the application:

 - Choose option 4 from the main menu.
 - You'll see a farewell message indicating that you're exiting the application.

### Additional Notes:

 - My application uses external packages like colored for colored text and rich for emoji and formatting.
 - Characters are stored in a CSV file named "characters.csv" for persistence.
 - Validation is implemented for race and class inputs to ensure they are within predefined options.
 - Error handling is in place for invalid inputs and missing CSV files.

That's the basic overview of how to play your RPG Character Creation System Application! Enjoy creating and managing your characters! If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any aspect, feel free to ask!
